              <p style="font-size: larger;">Arugam Bay is a hidden gem located on the east coast of Sri Lanka. 
                As it’s located far from the capital and other tourist attractions, 
                it is not really popular among tourists. Thus,

                to explore some offbeat destinations in Sri Lanka.

                <h3>A Tourist Destination for Surf 
                  Tourism and Natural Attractions in Sri Lanka's Southeast Coast.</h3>
                <p>The bay is located 117 kilometres (73 mi) south of Batticaloa, 
                  320 kilometres (200 mi) due east of Colombo, and approximately 4 kilometres 
                  (2.5 mi) south of the market town of Pottuvil.<br> The main settlement in the area, 
                  known locally as Ullae, is predominantly Muslim, however there is a significant 
                  Sri Lankan Tamil and Sinhala population to the south of the village, as well as a 
                  number of international expatriates, largely from Europe and Australia.<br> 
                  While traditionally fishing has dominated the local economy, 
                  tourism has grown rapidly in the area in recent years.<br> 
                  Arugam Kudah's literal Tamil translation is "Bay of Cynodon dactylon".<br> 
                  Tourism in Arugam Bay is dominated by surf tourism,
                   thanks to several quality breaks in the area, 
                   however tourists are also attracted by the local beaches, 
                   lagoons, historic temples and the nearby Kumana National Park.</p>
                <h3>Conflict between fishing and tourism</h3>
                <p>During the period of fighting between the central government and Tamil separatists tourism 
                  was fairly low key and the hotels often bought the catch of the fishermen.<br>
                   As a result of the peace, tourism expanded and many fishing people who had moved to areas
                    less touched by the conflict returned.<br> Hotel owners began to complain about the smell 
                    of drying fish and how the fishing huts blocked their view.<br>
                     In the aftermath of the Tsunami fishing people were forbidden to return, 
                     officially on the grounds of safety but allegedly as a result of pressure from 
                     the hotel owners.</p>
                <h3>Surrounding areas</h3>
                 <p>The nearby (4 kilometres (2.5 mi)) Muslim village of Pottuvil is the center 
                  of commerce and transportation while tourist accommodations lie along the beach to
                   the south of Pottuvil Arugam Bay (4 kilometres (2.5 mi)) is also the gateway and the only
                    road access to the Yala East National Park.<br>
                     In 2.2 kilometres (1.4 mi) distance there is Pasarichenai Beach.<br>
                      This area is known as Kumana (44 kilometres (27 mi)), to be reached via 
                      the Tamil/Sinhalese settlement of Panama (Sri Lanka) (17 kilometres (11 mi)) and 
                      the Tamil shires at Okanda (32 kilometres (20 mi)).<br>
                       The local area is home to a number of elephants, often travelling between
                        Lahugala and Kumana national parks.</p>
                <h3>Surfing</h3>
                <p>Arugam Bay is the most popular surf spot and is also the only international 
                  surf competition venue in Sri Lanka.<br>
                  It is also rated as one of the top ten surf destinations in the world.<br>
                   It has also hosted most of the international surfing competitions in Sri Lanka 
                   since 2004.<br> It also hosted the So Sri Lanka Pro 2019.</p>

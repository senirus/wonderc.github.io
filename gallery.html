                    The Galle Lighthouse is a historic landmark located in the
                    coastal city of Galle, Sri Lanka. It stands tall at the
                    southern tip of the island, guiding ships and boats entering
                    the Galle harbor since its establishment in 1848. The
                    lighthouse has undergone several renovations over the years,
                    but its classic white and red-striped appearance remains
                    iconic. Tourists often visit the Galle Lighthouse to enjoy
                    panoramic views of the Indian Ocean and explore the historic
                    Galle Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is in close
                    proximity to the lighthouse.

                    Horton Plains National Park is a pristine and biodiverse
                    protected area located in the central highlands of Sri
                    Lanka. It is situated in the Nuwara Eliya district and
                    encompasses an expansive plateau with lush grasslands, cloud
                    forests, and montane ecosystems. The park is famous for its
                    unique geography, including the World's End cliff and
                    Baker's Falls. It is home to several endemic species of
                    flora and fauna, making it a paradise for nature lovers and
                    wildlife enthusiasts. Trekking through Horton Plains offers
                    breathtaking vistas and a chance to explore the natural
                    wonders of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.
